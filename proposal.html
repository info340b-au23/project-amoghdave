        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>Finding a place to rent can be overwhelming and a very time-consuming experience. Specifically, University of Washington students should have a more comprehensive webpage to find their next home. A critical problem with the current situation is that to gather information on different places to rent, many websites, such as ‘Apartments.com’ and ‘Redfin’, have to be looked through, none of which are comprehensive enough. One of the most important aspects of finding a good place to rent is to hear from others about their personal rental experience. Currently, there is not a good web page that allows users to post and view reviews of different rental locations. Google does have information and reviews of buildings on Google Maps. This can be useful but viewing and posting reviews should be a part of an actual rental website so that users can easily access all the information they need to find their next home, best suited to their needs. </p>
