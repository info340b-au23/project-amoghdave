        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>Finding a place to rent can be overwhelming and a very time-consuming experience. Specifically, University of Washington students should have a more comprehensive webpage to find their next home. A critical problem with the current situation is that to gather information on different places to rent, many websites, such as ‘Apartments.com’ and ‘Redfin’, have to be looked through, none of which are comprehensive enough. One of the most important aspects of finding a good place to rent is to hear from others about their personal rental experience. Currently, there is not a good web page that allows users to post and view reviews of different rental locations. Google does have information and reviews of buildings on Google Maps. This can be useful but viewing and posting reviews should be a part of an actual rental website so that users can easily access all the information they need to find their next home, best suited to their needs. </p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p> Catered especially towards UW students, Husky Homes addresses the overwhelming experience of finding a rental place due to scattered information and the absence of a comprehensive review platform. There was also no way to see renter’s satisfaction or reviews. Husky Homes centralize the search for students by collecting and listing all available rentals near the University of Washington in one place, Husky Homes eliminates the need for students to browse multiple websites, greatly reducing the time and effort they would otherwise spend on gathering information. Users will be able to use a search bar to be able to peruse apartments specifically for University of Washington students. They can also use dropdown features (e.g. star rating, rent rate, # of bedrooms/bathrooms) to filter for apartments to suit their needs and preferences, especially if they are absolutely in the blue with their apartment search. The app will also employ the Firebase API to enable people to login and post reviews about apartments, better serving prospective tenants in their search. In addition, our application highlights personal experiences of those who lived in the rental by having the ability to add reviews. Beyond just finding a place, students need to ensure their safety and well-being. By integrating safety data and community metrics, Husky Homes ensures that students are well-informed about the neighborhoods they're considering. This is more than just a listing site. The community board nurtures a student community, where they can actively engage, discuss, and help each other out. Created by students for students. </p>
