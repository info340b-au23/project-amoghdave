    <h1>Husky Homes</h1>
    <p>4.Catered especially towards UW students, Husky Homes addresses the overwhelming experience of finding a rental place due to scattered information and the absence of a comprehensive review platform. Husky Homes centralize the search for students by collecting and listing all available rentals near the University of Washington in one place, Husky Homes eliminates the need for students to browse multiple websites, greatly reducing the time and effort they would otherwise spend on gathering information. In addition, our application highlights personal experiences of those who lived in the rental. Husky Homesâ€™ review system sources reviews from multiple sources and as a result, minimizes the affects of fake reviews. Beyond just finding a place, students need to ensure their safety and well-being. By integrating safety data and community metrics, Husky Homes ensures that students are well-informed about the neighborhoods they're considering. This is more than just a listing site. The community board nurtures a student community, where they can actively engage, discuss, and help each other out. Created by students for students.</p>
